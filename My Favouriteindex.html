My favorite subjects are Math and Science, My favorite color is yellow. This year I got promoted to 5th standard and secured 98%. I am learning coding in Whitehat Jr and completed all block-based coding. I have developed many apps like Calculator, Shopping App, Health App, Food Eatery App etc. using Code.org and Thunkable platform. Presently I am doing advance coding classes using HTML, CSS and JS. I got awarded Gold medal in IGKO & IMO, Silver medal in NSO and Bronze medal in IMO. My father's name is Mr. Ambika Prasad and mother's name is Mrs. Nivedita. My father is an engineer by profession. He works in BHEL. My father is my hero, he always inspires me to do good works. My mother is a good house wife and she teaches me coding and I love ❤ her. I wake up early in the morning, first I do my brain Gym and complete all my abacus practice.
            Also I take care my two lovely birds named Bunty and Bubbly .One day I was giving them food, they suddenly flew away that day was my saddest day, my dad decided to bring two more birds named chunu and munu at that time whenever I see my new birds I always remember my old birds. One interesting thing is that after some months chumu lay 12 eggs but 6 eggs are broken, the chick did not come, so now I am waiting for these 6 eggs and I pray that chicks will come out from those eggs🙏. he aim of my life is to become a Space Scientist. My goal is when I become a Space Scientist, I will fulfill my mother's wish.</p>
